Code Camp â€“ Project Briefing  

Overview: We are embarking on a multi-project software development initiative to enhance skills and collaboration among teams. The projects are designed to be language-independent, allowing flexibility in technology choices. Each team, consisting of three members, will be responsible for one of the specified projects.  

General Guidelines:
Language Independence: The projects should be implemented in a way that is not tied to a specific programming language, allowing teams to choose technologies that align with their expertise.  
Team Composition: Teams are to be formed with three members each. This ensures collaboration, shared responsibilities, and diverse perspectives.  
Testing: Code must be thoroughly tested to ensure functionality and reliability. Teams should adopt appropriate testing frameworks to achieve high code quality.  
Reporting: weekly, each team will have to provide an update on their progress during the Code Camps.  
Project Timeline: The development phase will last four weeks. On the fifth week, teams will dedicate time to building a presentation covering their project's features and challenges. The presentation will be delivered during the sixth week.  
Presentation Requirements:
      Ticket Addressal: Teams need to address and demonstrate how they tackled each user story (ticket). Clear explanations and code walkthroughs are encouraged.  
      Challenges Faced: Teams should elaborate on the most challenging aspects encountered during development and how they overcame these challenges.

Project 6: Fitness Tracking App

User Story 1: Activity Logging: As a user, I want to log and track my daily physical activities, including exercise, steps, and other fitness-related metrics. 

User Story 2: Goal Setting: As a user, I want to set fitness goals, receive progress updates, and celebrate achievements within the app 

User Story 3: Social Integration: As a user, I want to connect with friends, share achievements, and engage in friendly fitness challenges for motivation. 

User story 4: Data Visualization: As a user, I want the app to present visualizations of my fitness data over time, helping me analyze trends and make informed decisions.
